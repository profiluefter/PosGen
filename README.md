# PosGen

A utility that generates NetBeans projects with certain requirements.

## Features

- Create a valid NetBeans project with either Ant or Maven
- Optionally inserts [my CLIGui Library](https://gitlab.com/profiluefter/CLIGui) into the project
- Fast to use console interface

## Intended Use Case

This tool was originally made for my personal use in school. I probably already invested more time in this project than it will ever save me so feel free to use it as well.

## Todo

- Apache Maven project generation
- Menu option to select if JUnit 4 should be added to the project
- Automatically update itself and libraries using GitLab/GitHub API

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this tool you can do so on the [upstream GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/profiluefter/PosGen). Pull requests on the GitHub mirror will not be merged.
